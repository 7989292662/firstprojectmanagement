Using GitHub's project management tools like milestones, issues, and project boards enhances team collaboration by providing clear task assignments, progress tracking, and centralized communication.
Milestones help set clear goals, while issues allow detailed task descriptions, labels, and assignments, ensuring everyone knows their responsibilities. 
Project boards visually organize tasks into stages like "To Do" and "In Progress," making it easier to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks.
Challenges might include getting all team members comfortable with the tools and ensuring consistent updates to the board. 
However, with proper onboarding and regular check-ins, these tools can significantly improve project organization and efficiency.
